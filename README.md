Daniel Meyer's Italian portfolio
This was created for a project for Italian 22 (6th semester Italian) at Tufts University and was created to demonstrate my knowledge of the Italian language as well as the work that I have completed for this class. This portfolio is a work in progress and will be updated as time goes on.
